## 📋 Project Overview

This Final Year Project (FYP) analyzes and predicts export volumes of kernel-based coconut products from Sri Lanka (2015-2025). The project combines advanced machine learning techniques with comprehensive exploratory data analysis to provide actionable insights for the coconut export industry.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing & Integration**: Clean and merge export data with external economic factors (exchange rates, domestic prices, consumption patterns)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, seasonality, and correlations in coconut product exports
3. **Product Segmentation**: Cluster products based on behavioral patterns using K-Means, Hierarchical, and GMM algorithms
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast future export volumes using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
5. **Business Intelligence Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of insights and predictions
